# Tweet Relevance Excercise

Excercise to gain familiarity with the Twitter Streaming API.

I monitored the Public Stream of Tweets for 2 hours using tweepy, then I conducted an exploratory and confirmatory
analysis for 4 features taken from the Tweet Relevance Judgment problem defined in [this work](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-838/paper_08.pdf).
